jacana-xy is a discriminatively trained bilingual aligner framework adapted from [jacana-align](http://code.google.com/p/jacana/), the monolingual (English-English) aligner.

It currently supports only aligning from French to English with a very limited feature set, from the one week hack at the [Eighth MT Marathon 2013](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/mtm13/). Please feel free to check out the code, read the [wiki](JacanaXY.md), or send the [author](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~xuchen) an email if you want to add more language pairs to it.
