# jacana-xy

= Introduction =

jacana-xy is a token-based word aligner for machine translation, adapted from the original English-English word aligner [http://code.google.com/p/jacana/ jacana-align] described in the following paper:

= Build =

jacana-xy is written in a mixture of Java and Scala. If you build from ant, you have to set up the environmental variables JAVA_HOME and SCALA_HOME. In my system, I have:

`export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun-1.6.0.26`

`export SCALA_HOME=/home/xuchen/Downloads/scala-2.10.2`

Then type:

`ant`

`build/lib/jacana-xy.jar` will be built for you.

If you build from Eclipse, first install [http://scala-ide.org/ scala-ide], then import the whole jacana folder as a Scala project. Eclipse should find the `.project` file and set up the project automatically for you.

= Demo =

`scripts-align/runDemoServer.sh` shows up the web demo. Direct your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and you should be able to align some sentences.

Note: To make jacana-xy know where to look for resource files, pass the property JACANA_HOME with Java when you run it:

`java -DJACANA_HOME=/path/to/jacana -cp jacana-xy.jar ......`

= Browser =

You can also browse one or two alignment files (`*`.json) with *firefox* opening `src/web/AlignmentBrowser.html`:

Note 1: due to strict security setting for accessing local files, Chrome/IE won't work.

Note 2: the input `*`.json files have to be in the same folder with `AlignmentBrowser.html`.

= Align =

`scripts-align/alignFile.sh` aligns tab-separated sentence files and outputs the output to a .json file that's accepted by the browser:

`java -DJACANA_HOME=../ -jar ../build/lib/jacana-xy.jar -src fr -tgt en -m fr-en.model -a s.txt -o s.json`

`scripts-align/alignFile.sh` takes GIZA++-style input files (one file containing the source sentences, and the other file the target sentences) and outputs to one .align file with dashed alignment indices (e.g. "1-2 0-4"):

`java -DJACANA_HOME=../ -jar ../build/lib/jacana-xy.jar -m fr-en.model -src fr -tgt en -a s1.txt -b s2.txt -o s.align`

= Training =

`java -DJACANA_HOME=../ -jar ../build/lib/jacana-xy.jar -r train.json -d dev.json -t test.json -m /tmp/align.model`

The aligner then would train on `train.json`, and report F1 values on `dev.json` for every 10 iterations, when the stopping criterion has reached, it will test on `test.json`. 

For every 10 iterations, a model file is saved to (in this example) `/tmp/align.model.iter_XX.F1_XX.X`. Normally what I do is to select the one with the best F1 on `dev.json`, then run a final test on `test.json`:

`java -DJACANA_HOME=../ -jar ../build/lib/jacana-xy.jar -t test.json -m /tmp/align.model.iter_XX.F1_XX.X`

In this case since the training data is missing, the aligner assumes it's a test job, then reads model file still from the `-m` option, and test on `test.json`.

All the json files are in a format like the following (also accepted by the browser for display):

{{{
[
    {
        "id": "0008",
        "name": "Hansards.english-french.0008",
        "possibleAlign": "0-0 1-0 2-0",
        "source": "hear , hear !",
        "sureAlign": "3-1",
        "target": "bravo !"
    },
    {
        "id": "0009",
        "name": "Hansards.english-french.0009",
        "possibleAlign": "1-1 5-6 5-7 6-6 6-7 10-13 11-13",
        "source": "Mr. Speaker , my question is directed to the Minister of Transport .",
        "sureAlign": "0-0 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 7-8 8-9 9-10 10-12 11-14 12-15",
        "target": "monsieur le Orateur , ma question se adresse à le ministre chargé de les transports ."
    }
]
}}}

Where `possibleAlign` is not used.

The stopping criterion is to run up to 300 iterations or when the objective difference between two iterations is less than 0.001, whichever happens first. Currently they are hard-coded. If you need to be flexible on this, send me an email!
